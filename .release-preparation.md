# 1.0.0 Release Preparation

## Current State
- Version in package.json: 0.3.0
- All fixes staged on branch: `cursor/repository-stabilization-and-release-5cea`
- All workflows tested and verified working
- Documentation branded and building correctly

## Release Strategy

### Semantic Release Configuration

The CI workflow uses `python-semantic-release` which determines version bumps from commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `fix:` → PATCH (0.3.0 → 0.3.1)
- `feat:` → MINOR (0.3.0 → 0.4.0)  
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → MAJOR (0.3.0 → 1.0.0)

### Commit Message for 1.0.0

When this branch is merged, the commit message should include:

```
feat!: stabilize repository for 1.0.0 release

BREAKING CHANGE: Documentation migrated from Sphinx to TypeDoc

This commit stabilizes the repository for v1.0.0 release:

- Add MIT LICENSE file (closes #18)
- Migrate documentation from Sphinx (Python) to TypeDoc (TypeScript)
- Add jbcom branding to documentation
- Fix all workflow failures (CI, Docker, Docs)
- Add pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Add usage examples
- Update CHANGELOG for 1.0.0

Breaking changes:
- Documentation is now generated with TypeDoc instead of Sphinx
- Documentation URL structure has changed
- Python documentation dependencies removed
```

### Post-Merge CI Flow

Once this branch is merged to main:

1. **CI Workflow Triggers**
   - Build and test pass
   - `python-semantic-release` detects BREAKING CHANGE
   - Version bumped to 1.0.0 in package.json
   - Git tag v1.0.0 created
   - Commit pushed to main

2. **NPM Publish**
   - Package published to npm as @agentic-dev-library/triage@1.0.0
   - Requires NPM_TOKEN secret to be configured

3. **GitHub Release**
   - Release created with tag v1.0.0
   - Release notes auto-generated from CHANGELOG

4. **Docker Build**
   - Image built and pushed to ghcr.io/agentic-dev-library/triage:1.0.0
   - Also tagged as :latest

5. **Documentation Deployment**
   - TypeDoc docs built
   - Deployed to GitHub Pages
   - Available at https://agentic-dev-library.github.io/triage/

## Required GitHub Secrets

Verify these secrets are configured in the repository:

- ✅ `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- ⚠️  `NPM_TOKEN` - Required for npm publish (check if configured)
- ✅ `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` - For test coverage (optional, may already be configured)

## Merge Sequence

### Step 1: Merge Current Branch
```bash
gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --head cursor/repository-stabilization-and-release-5cea \
  --title "feat!: stabilize repository for 1.0.0 release" \
  --body "$(cat .final-status-report.md)"
```

Then merge the PR (or push directly if this is a protected automation branch).

### Step 2: Merge PR #53
```bash
gh pr merge 53 --squash --auto
```

### Step 3: Close PR #54
```bash
gh pr close 54 --comment "Superseded by repository stabilization work in cursor/repository-stabilization-and-release-5cea which includes complete TypeDoc configuration, workflow fixes, and jbcom branding."
```

## Monitoring Release

### Watch CI Workflow
```bash
gh run watch
```

### Verify Deployments

1. **NPM Package**
   ```bash
   npm view @agentic-dev-library/triage version
   # Should show: 1.0.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Release**
   ```bash
   gh release view v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/agentic-dev-library/triage:1.0.0
   docker pull ghcr.io/agentic-dev-library/triage:latest
   ```

4. **Documentation**
   - Visit: https://agentic-dev-library.github.io/triage/
   - Verify jbcom branding is applied
   - Check that dark theme is default
   - Verify navigation works
